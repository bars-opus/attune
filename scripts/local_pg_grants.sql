-- Applied AFTER all migrations. ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES only covers tables
-- created afterwards by the same role, so a blanket grant is what actually
-- reproduces Supabase's platform-side privileges across the whole schema.
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public
  TO authenticated, service_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public
  TO authenticated, service_role, anon;
-- Deliberately NOT granting EXECUTE on all functions.
--
-- Supabase's default is EXECUTE for PUBLIC on new functions, and the
-- migrations then REVOKE it from the SECURITY DEFINER RPCs that must not be
-- callable by clients. A blanket GRANT here would re-grant exactly those and
-- silently defeat every function-privilege contract -- dating_mode_contracts
-- asserts, for instance, that `authenticated` cannot execute
-- block_dating_user(text,uuid), which a blanket grant would make false.
--
-- So function privileges are left exactly as the migrations leave them.
